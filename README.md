# PhD_thesis

This repositiory shows all the main code used in my thesis to solve interacting systems of PDEs.

1. Pre-impact phase of droplet impact onto a viscoelastic surface (Sec. 2.1.2)
  'pre_impact_viscoelastic_code.m'
  
  F_TT = (PV) int_(-infinity)^infinity (e3*G_Q+e5*G_TQ)/(X-Q) dQ/pi,
  ((F-G)^3*(e3*G_X+e5*G_TX))_X = 12*(F-G)_T
